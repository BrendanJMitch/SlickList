# Mitchell Server

Brendan Mitchell
June 18 2023


This is the codebase for the Mitchell home server. This server hosts my website
which you can find [here][website].

[website]: http://brendan.us.to

## Possible Projects

The following projects may at some point be hosted on the Mitchell server (no
commitments!):

- A shopping list app for saving recipes, auto generating shopping lists, 
  and planning shopping routes. 
- A nice homepage intoducing me and the website
- A feature requests page

## Usage

This website is primarily for my use, but it is set up to be available to anyone.
If others find it useful, great! I just can't guarantee it will be up forever, 
so don't get too hooked. 

## Markdown syntax for reference

Here are some examples for later use when I expand this readme:

- Brackets can make a link to a [url](https://github.com) or to a [section](#Markdown syntax for reference)
  within the same document (marked by a header)
- Underscores let you _italicize_ a segment of text
- Double asterisks let you **bold** a segment
- Backticks mean `code_segment`
- Triple backticks let you create a multiline code segment:
```
import hello

if __name__ == '__main__':
	hello.say_hello("Hello World!")
```
